Background is grey. Elevation and cliffs are hidden for better clarity.
Grey's color on the minimap is dark purple.
Stone is rose.
Rest is basically the same, slightly tweaked for contrast.

I very much like the terrain color mode where you can see your vision. It gives you a better
understanding of your map control.

I also like friend foe colors on the minimap.
I'd love if we could have them on the minimap only and the real player colors on the units...
