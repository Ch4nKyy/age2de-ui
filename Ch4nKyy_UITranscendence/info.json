TODO

Every relevant RTS game has the minimap on the left instead of the right, so I want to follow this.
However, I think a centered minimap is even more advantageous. I didn't put it dead center,
because I think the unit selection panel is also important to be centered, e.g. for ghosting micro.
Also, I prefer a clustered UI instead of spreading it out to the corners.

Minimap bottom is center, left.
Unit selection is bottom center, right.
Resources and technology progress are above them.
Idle villager and house warning are very central, too.

Unit groups are displayed above the minimap, but only 5. I don't use more than 5 groups for units,
and I'm not interested to see building groups. I might even disable them, because I don't like that
they are clickable and I never look at them consciously.
It was a bit annoying to get them over the minimap, because I had to increase the size of the whole
command panel and now the resource panel is not clickable anymore, but I don't click that anyway.
