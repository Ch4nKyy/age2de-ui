SC2 and WC3 have the minimap on the left and command panel on the right, so I want to follow this.
However, I think a centered minimap is even more advantageous.
Also, I prefer a clustered UI instead of spreading it out to the corners.

Minimap is bottom center, left.
Unit selection is bottom center, right.
Resources and technology progress are above them.
Idle villager and house warning are very central, too.

Unit groups are displayed above the command panel, but only 5.
I don't use more than 5 groups for units, and I'm not interested to see building groups.
I usually even disable them, because I don't like that
they are clickable and I never look at them consciously.
It is a bit annoying to position them outside the unit selection section. I had to increase
the size of the whole command panel.
