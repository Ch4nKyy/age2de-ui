MAKE SURE TO ALSO USE [Ch4nKyy] Transparent HUD!

SC2 and WC3 have the minimap on the left and command panel on the right, so I want to follow this.
However, I think a centered minimap is even more advantageous.
Also, I prefer a clustered UI instead of spreading it out to different corners.

I think a fully centered minimap could be even cooler.

Unit groups are displayed above the command panel, but only 5 here.
I don't use more than 5 groups for units, and I'm not interested to see building groups.
I usually even disable them, because I don't like that
they are clickable in Age2 and I rarely look at them.
It is a bit annoying to position them outside the unit selection section. I had to increase
the size of the whole command panel.","Title":"[Ch4nKyy] UI Semi-Center"}
