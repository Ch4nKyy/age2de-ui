MAKE SURE TO ALSO USE [Ch4nKyy] Transparent HUD!

I mainly play SC2, so I want a similar UI layout in AoE2.
In SC2, I didn't like that the resource bar is in the opposite corner of the minimap, but I found
an easy way to put it above the minimap, so I copied this style here.

I like the technologyprogresspanel to be close to the center of the screen, because I think it
helps me not forget villager and military production. It might be a bit too close though and cause
missclicks. I'll have to test it. Alternatively, I could put it where the control group icons are,
or above the minimap, but then the first 1-2 items are really in the far peripheral vision.","Title":"[Ch4nKyy] UI SC2 Modded"}
